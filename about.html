        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2 class="name">@di</h2>
        <p class="description">I have a knack for turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. Whether it's troubleshooting deployment issues or refining a machine learning algorithm to outsmart a game, I'm always up for the challenge. My approach is pragmatic, blending deep technical expertise with a curiosity to experiment and improve. Outside of coding, I manage life's little quirksâ€”like finding the right quick meals to fuel my day or caring for a cat that's on the mend. I move forward with focus, always keeping an eye on what's next.</p>
